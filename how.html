                <h2>How do we do it?</h2>
                <p>We can do it by spreading the word of the importance of Universal Design so more people are aware of it.  
                    Everyone from UX engineers, graphic designers, content creators, politicians and executives should know of Universal Design
                    and its guiding principles. They can then use the 7 principles of Universal Design to create accessible digital media.
                </p>
                <p> Then, the creation of accessible digital media should be recognized and celebrated so more people follow suit and our
                    online world becomes more and more accessible for everyone.
                </p>
                <p> The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 mandated that many physical spaces be accessible to everyone, 
                    like public transportation and buildings with stairs having ramps or elevators as well.
                    There is a case for a digital version of the Americans with Disabilities act to be made into law,
                    since so much of our current world takes place in a digital landscape instead of a physical one.
                    Calling and sending letters to your represantives would be a good first step in this direction.</p>

                <p><strong>Fun Fact: </strong>In a survey distributed to 500 leading professionals, 50.53% of web developers/designers reported that they are only "fairly familiar" with web accessibility. Many ranked their understanding to be even lower.</p>
