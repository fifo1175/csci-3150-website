                <h2>What is it?</h2>
                <p>Universal Design is the intentional design of digital media to be accessible for everyone.  
                    It prioritizes accessiblity for all users, especially those with disabilties, so online content can be enjoyed by everyone.
                </p>
                <p>Another great thing about Universal Design, is that it does not just benefit those with disabilities, but society as a whole.
                    Many things that have been created using Universal Design benefit people without disabilities as well, such as voice recognition
                    software, sidewalk ramps made for people in wheelchairs, and doors that automatically open when you get close all benefit multiple
                    groups of people.  Drivers that want to send a text using Siri benefit from voice recognition, parents with strollers benefit from
                    the sidewalk ramps, and people who are carrying lots of things benefit from automatic doors.
                </p>
                <p>So, Universal Design is really about benefiting all of society while making equitable and accessible things.  It's pretty neat!</p>
                <p>Universal Design utilizes 7 core principles: Equitable Use, Flexibility in Use, Simple and Intuitive Use, Percetible Information, Tolerance for Error, Low Physical Effort, Size and Space for Approach and Use</p>
                <p><strong>Fun Fact: </strong>Emerging technologies will allow 350 million people with disabilities to enter the workplace over the next 10 years.</p>
