                <h2>Why do we need it?</h2>
                <p>We need Universal Design to make digital content accessible for everyone.  
                    So much of our world lives online now, and designing digital content with accessiblity in mind ensures online information
                can reach the widest range of people possible.</p>
                <p>Accessiblity is incorporated into many different domains, from building construction to concerts.  People who create digital content
                    needs to follow suit to make sure nobody is left behind in the digital age and society will benefit as a whole. </p>
                <p>
                    Incorporating Universal Design into prodoucts also makes sense from not just an ethical perspective, but a business perspective as well.
                    Products and technologies that can be used by the widest range of people will generate more revenue for a business, since more customers
                    will want the product.  Furthermore, Incorporating Universal Design into products from the start could save a business lots of money in the future
                    because unmet requirements will already be taken care of, thus reducing the time and cost to improve the product.  
                </p>
